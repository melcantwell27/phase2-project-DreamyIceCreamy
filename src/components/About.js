            I have been an ice-cream lover since the age of birthday cakes. The best part of birthday cakes for me always was the side of ice cream.

            As I have aged like a fermented kefir culture, I have been less inclined towards dairy and more inclined towards nuanced flavors beyond sugar, the CREATION of all that which is to be desired (in ice cream). That's when I took it upon myself to get an ice cream maker & start experimenting.

            Coconut cream-based ice cream is more friendly to the vegans of Brooklyn as well as the lactose-intolerant among us, not to mention the anti-fungal gut-benefits inherent in coconut. The frozen bananas that you'll see in many of these recipes are optional for thicc creaminess and can balance out the fattiness of the coconut cream alone.

            There are many other ways to do this I'm sure, frozen other foods that are low sugar but can provide a creamy base, I'm thinking aloe vera cubes, frozen oat milk cubes, or other nut milks.
