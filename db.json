      "recipe": "Ingredients\n1 can coconut milk\n1 can coconut cream\nÂ¼ - Â½ cup honey\n1 tablespoon espresso powder\n1 cups Enjoy Life Chocolate Chips\nI used mini and morsels\nInstructions\nTurn the burner on medium-high and whisk together the coconut creams, honey and espresso powder.\nThe mixture should come to a low bowl. Turn down to low and cook for about five minutes, stirring frequently. You will have to whisk well, bc the coconut milk separates in the can.\nRemove from pan and place in the fridge for several hours. Or you can place the container on the counter in a large bowl of ice. It must be cold before you put it in the ice cream maker.\nAdd chocolate chips and stir. You cannot add chocolate chips to a warm coconut mixture or they will melt.\nPour into your ice cream maker and follow manufacturers directions.\nIt took mine about 20 minutes to come together.\nServe immediately for soft-serve style or place back in the freezer for a hard packed ice cream.",
