Phase 2 Final Project: Dreamy Ice Creamy

This project is to showcase the React skills built during Phase 2. 

My "Dreamy Ice Creamy" site, there is a NavBar with "Menu", "New Recipe", and "About" links. Upon click of ...
1. Menu: a list of recipes & their iamges will populate
2. [a recipe card within] Menu: the image & recipe/ingredients of the selected recipe will show in a new page
3. New Recipe, users can submit a form to add a recipe name, recipe/ingredients, and imageUrl.
  a. Upon form submission, the site will navigate to show the new recipe page.
  b. The new recipe will be added to contents on the Menu page.
5. About, users can learn a bit about the love behind non-dairy ice cream experimentation, as well as health benefits in doing so!

Requirements: 
1. A single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.
2. App should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized.
3. There should be at least 3 client-side routes using React RouterLinks to an external site. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes. |

4. Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.

5. Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using styled componentsLinks to an external site. or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements, or via the incorporation of a UI framework.
